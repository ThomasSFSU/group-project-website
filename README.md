# Group Project One
This website is a modern fact sheet to display information about Queen.

## Description
For our project, Cedric Blanco and I designed and created a website to display facts about the famous rock band Queen. To design the top nav, we referenced a tutorial called Sticky Navigation Bar On Scroll Using Vanilla Javascript | Fixed Navbar on Scroll from a YouTube channel called Online Tutorials. To integrate emojis, we utilized the ::before and ::after pseudo elements to add emojis before links and after the contact heading. We also used the :hover pseudo class to make links appear obviously clickable.

The design was inspired in large part by a minimalistic black-and-white theme found in some of Queenâ€™s original photographs. We found a specific font that matched the text of the Queen logo and used this for headings, though to use it for the body copy would lead to legibility concerns, so we opted for a simple sans-serif font: Roboto. Adding a glow effect to the contact button and slight text enlargement on link hover really makes the page feel responsive to user interaction. Overall, this was a very interesting project to design and build.
